### Day 1 ###
I'm trying to make the schema , put it neatly in every folders and giving `Router` in my apps. To make it perfect , i add some index , so it would be easy to call out all the components

### Day 2 ###
<<<<<<< HEAD
creating the design for the register page , soon making the navbar and footer for whole pages , looking forward this project in 2 weeks !

### Day 3 ###
i add some in school , dont have times to add the home and main app pages , maybe will fix later , also i just learn you can't have 2 `Router` and use them at the same time , only 1 `Router` exist and `Router-dom` v6 change how you use the link , it needs a path and element in 1 markup
